        <p><b><i>Sushiis a traditional</i></b>&nbsp;Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice ( sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, 
           accompanied by a variety of ingredients , such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables.
           Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari , or sumeshi.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>sushi rice</li>
            <li>bamboo sushi mat</li>
            <li>plastic wrap (cling/saran wrap)</li>
            <li>nori seaweed sheets</li>
            <li>low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>toasted sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Sriracha</li>
            <li>wasabi&nbsp;pickled ginger</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>cooking steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook rice in water until it boils. Cover and simmer until grains are soft. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, chop filling into strips or sticks.</li>
            <li>Mix sugar and vinegar. Combine it with cooled rice – this gives it flavour and stickiness.</li>
            <li>On your sushi bamboo mat, spread out 1 sheet of nori.</li>
            <li>Cover it as thinly as you can with the rice mixture. Leave an uncovered 2cm strip of nori along the top edge (to seal the roll).</li>
            <li>In the centre of the nori, lay out horizontal lines of your filling (eg. a line of salmon and a line of cucumber). Don’t overload your sushi with filling.</li>
            <li>Now for the tricky part. Grip the mat firmly in both hands and roll up sushi as tight as you can. The mat will help you apply even pressure along the roll. Note: don’t roll up the mat into the sushi!</li>
            <li>Wet the rice-free strip of nori and ‘glue’ it to the sushi roll.</li>
            <li>Chop the roll into 3cm slices – you’re done!  Repeat steps 4-9 with different fillings for the remaining 3 sheets of nori. You will get better with every roll!</li>
